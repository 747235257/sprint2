Sprint 5 was divided as follows: 
Enemy Tracking/Asset Imports - Kyrie Iswandy
Random Levels/Parry/HealthItem/MapItem: Haikal
Scoreboard- Beal
ICommand/Sound - Akmal
FinalBoss  -  DengChen
Random  Chest  -  Nathan

Overall, the team had very different functionalities to work on, so the team was able to work on their separate stuff without any conflicts. The team found success in implementing their own classes and ran into barely any
issues adding them to the eisting project.

Github issues were absent in this project. A huge improvement from earlier sprints.

Though these features were not really connected in an obvious way, the team believes that combined - it does make the game feel more "Whole". It feels more fun to play and has an identity of it's own.

Newly imported assets for the player, enemies and the boss also makes the game feel more unique to the team. The assets are made by the talented Kyrie Iswandy and they add so much value to the game.

The music, made by Deng Chen's contact, also helps with the identity of the game.
