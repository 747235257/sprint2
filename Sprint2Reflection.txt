Sprint 2 Reflection (DZNT)

Below are reflections from each member:

1) Haikal: Overall, I think the team had to overcome a huge hurdle in figuring out how github worked as well as how to mesh together separately-worked-on components into one whole project. The team was able to
implement the separate classes they were assigned in a timely manner. However, uploading them to github without major issues took longer. We were able to understand the workflow with github and we hope future 
sprints are smoother. Our process was to work on classes separately, meet up in person, then figure out how to mesh them all. In the future, I think the team should meet up more often to more easily connect
components.

2)Akmal:

3)Beal: I love how this group communicate with each other and make sure that our work is synchronized and up to date. Everyone knows what they are doing and most of them finished their parts early, making it easy to fix the bugs and errors. We bonded well with each other and I am looking forward to working for the next sprints. We might have some trouble using GitHub but we figured it out at last and get everything done.

4)Dengchen:

5)Nathan: I think every one on this team is great. They all are smart guys who know how to socialize and communicate when we need help with anything. Everyone is willing to help anyone with a question or struggle 
and it feels we are all working well together because of this. We all struggled with github for the most part I believe and everything else has been at least good or ok.
