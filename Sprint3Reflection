Sprint 3 Reflection

Overall, the Level classes and the Collision Handling classes were straightforward in implementing. The JSON files took a bit of experimenting to find the correct placements of doors and objects.

From Sprint 2, the team had a way easier time dealing with github and didn't run into too many issues with pushing/pulling work.

Implementing these newer features with the older classes in sprint2 also did not prove to be too difficult for the team.
