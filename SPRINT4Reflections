SPRINT 4 Reflections

Overall, the team ran into little to few issues with pushing/pulling code from github.
The team had no issue dividing the tasks equally.

Sound and Music was simple and easy enough to implement.
HUD had some complexities, since HUD had to be updated in real time - which includes HP, MAP, and Item slots.
Levels had to be refactored to support level clearing.
Inventory/Pause Screen also had some complexities, because the team had to stop all updates, and allow for item switching.
Victory Screen and Game Over Screen were simple enough to implement.
