README FOR SPRINT 2 (DZNT)

Authors: Haikal Bin Rozaidi, Akmal Hasrudin, Beal Norazilan, Kyrie Iswandy, Dengchen Mei, Nathan Sprott.

Program: 2D top down zelda-like game.

Description: Currently, the program supports the player class, the enemy class, projectiles, blocks and items. The player is controlled through keyboard input and switching enemies/blocks/items are also handled through
the keyboard

To fix/bugs/smells: 
1) Walk animation doesn't reset in PLAYER
2) Make multiple different projectile classes, not just one PROJECTILE
3) Remove magic numbers in ALL CLASSES
